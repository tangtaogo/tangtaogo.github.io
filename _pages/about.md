I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. I am a member of [HCP-Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/), supervised by Professor [Xiaodan Liang](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LiangXiaodan). My resume is here: [resume-PDF](/files/cv.pdf). 
Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in School of Software from Dalian University of Technolog.

Current Status
------------------------
🔥 I am actively looking for job opportunities and plan to graduate in 2026!!!

Research Interests
------------------------
My research focuses on learning 2D and 3D representations of objects and scenes to improve the accuracy and robustness of autonomous driving and robotics tasks. 

- Currently, I am exploring sensor simulation and data generation (i.e., World Model). 

- I am also investigating the self-improving capability of vision-language-action (VLA) models.

- My prior research focuses were on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). 

<!-- I work closely with [Wenwei Zhang](http://zhangwenwei.cn/), [Sheng Jin](https://jin-s13.github.io/) and [Lumin Xu](https://github.com/luminxu). -->
