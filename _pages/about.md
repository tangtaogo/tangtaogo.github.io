I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. I am a member of [HCP-Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/), supervised by Professor [Xiaodan Liang](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LiangXiaodan). My resume is here: [resume-PDF](/files/cv.pdf). 
Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in school of Software from Dalian University of Technolog.


My research focuses on learning 2D and 3D representations of objects and scenes to improve the accuracy and robustness of perception tasks in complex environments. 
Currently, I am exploring sensor simulation and data generation for autonomous driving and robotics. 
I am also investigating the self-improving capability of vision-language-action (VLA) models.
My prior research focuses were on Self-Supervised Learning and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). 
<!-- I work closely with [Wenwei Zhang](http://zhangwenwei.cn/), [Sheng Jin](https://jin-s13.github.io/) and [Lumin Xu](https://github.com/luminxu). -->
